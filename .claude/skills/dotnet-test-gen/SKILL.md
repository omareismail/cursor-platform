name: dotnet-test-gen
description: "dotnet-test-gen generates a complete, runnable test file for a given .NET source file. It analyses the source to determine whether it is a domain entity, a MediatR handler/query, or a repository, and generates the appropriate test pattern for each: pure xUnit for domain logic, xUnit with Moq/NSubstitute for handlers, and xUnit with TestContainers for repository integration tests. Invoked as /dotnet-test-gen."

## How to run this skill

1. **Read `.cursor/skills/dotnet-test-gen/skill.md` now** and follow every step literally.
2. Apply the platform contract in `AGENTS.md`:
   - **Category:** A (generates/modifies files) - announce, then wait for go-ahead
   - Announcement (unless Category D): `**Matched skill:** dotnet-test-gen - [one-line description].`
3. Guard rules in `.cursor/rules/` are binding. Claude Code does not auto-load
   `.mdc` files, so read the matching rule before generating:

   | Files touched | Read first (in `.cursor/rules/`) |
   |---|---|
   | `**/*.cs`, `**/*.csproj` | `02-dotnet-architecture-guard.mdc`, `07-audit-trail-guard.mdc` |
   | `**/*.tsx`, `**/*.ts` | `03-react-architecture-guard.mdc`, `08-rtl-i18n-guard.mdc` |
   | `**/*.sql`, `**/*.cs` | `06-database-provider-guard.mdc` |
   | any of the above | `04-security-guard.mdc` |

   Rules `00`, `05`, `09`, `10` are always binding - summarised in `CLAUDE.md`
   and injected by the `SessionStart` hook.
4. After significant work, update `memory-bank/activeContext.md` and
   `memory-bank/progress.md`.
